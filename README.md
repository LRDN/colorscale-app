# ColorScale

ColorScale is a simple React SPA to generate color palettes by defining an HSV range, transition curve and step count. Colors are saved in the browser's local storage and can be exported to CSS, SCSS, JSON and SVG.

Built using [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), [Feather Icons](https://github.com/feathericons/feather) and [Colord](https://github.com/omgovich/colord)\
Inspired by [ColorBox](https://github.com/lyft/coloralgorithm) by Lyft Design
